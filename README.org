#+TITLE: Emacs configuration.

* Introduction
It's just my Emacs configuration. Emacs itself along with some packages are managed by nix with the help of [[https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay][emacs-overlay]] from nix-community.

* Install
Change ~nixpkgs~ configuration according to notes in _foci.nix_, run:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  nix-env -iA nixpkgs.fociEmacs
#+END_SRC

This installs a partial set of packages, rest of them is listed in ~package-selected-packages~. They are being moved to nix-based installation over time, checking whether they are still relevant takes time ...
